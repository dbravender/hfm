Gentooicons  Oct 17 1999
========================

General
-------
All icons were hand-crafted by Johan Hanson <johan@tiq.com>, originally
for the file manager Gentoo by Emil Brink.

The latest version of these icons can be found at
"http://www.obsession.se/johan/gentooicons.html".
Gentoo can be found at "http://www.obsession.se/gentoo/".

I would be happy to recieve any comments and/or icons that you may have
based on my work. A version in size 32x32 is *not* under way, but I have
made a few images that you can get if you mail me.

If you think you can do better than me, don't hesitate to send your
artwork to me and maybe it will be included in the next release.
I'm actually not an artist, just a programmer that believes he has a
sense for style. =)

Try my GTK theme "Xenophilia". It is plain, grey, and very nice.
It is implemented as a theme engine, thus it is faster than pixmap
themes. You can find it at http://www.obsession.se/johan/gtk.html

Further distribution
--------------------
If you want to redistribute icons from this package, please consider
distributing the whole package. (including this README)
Also, I would be happy to recieve an email about your redistribution.
Those things are not required, but they strenghten my ego. =)
