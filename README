hfm is my personal attempt to create a useful and pretty alternative
file manager for X based on the GNOME libraries (gtk+/glib/bonobo).  

features
--------
1. bonobo component preview of file contents (text, image, etc.)
2. several launcher buttons for different types of actions that can be
   performed on files based on their mime type

inspiration / petty theft
-------------------------
As I was making hfm, I was frequently looking at code written by Geert
Bevin from his fm file manager (http://thunderstorms.org/fm).  I also 
borrowed the icons from the Gentoo file manager 
(http://www.obsession.se/gentoo/).

build
-----

To build hfm, you will need recent GNOME libraries and their headers 
and the Gtk Object Builder (GOB).  (Debian users can simply run the 
command 'apt-get install libgnome-dev libbonobo-dev gob'.)  

* Untar the package 'tar zvxf hfm.tar.gz'.
* 'cd hfm'.
* Then 'make'.

icons and launcher customization
--------------------------------
In order to have hfm recognize which icons to display for any given 
file you have to set up an hfm.keys file in your ~/.gnome/mime-info/ 
directory,  An example hfm.keys file comes in the tarball.  The
syntax for adding icons is hfm-icon=[icon file].  To add launchers the
syntax is hfm-action=[label]=[command][, [label]=[command]]... For the
mime type image/* the hfm-action might be as follows:

image/*:
	hfm-action=view=eog %f, edit=gimp %f
